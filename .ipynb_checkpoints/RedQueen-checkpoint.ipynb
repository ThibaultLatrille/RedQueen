    "PRDM9 is a meiosis-specific histone methyltransferase with a tandem-repeat zinc finger (ZnF) domain encoded by a minisatellite-like sequence. The ZnF domain is polymorphic in repeat number and type, and appears to be directly responsible for activating hotspots by binding to hotspot-associated sequence motifs in both humans and mice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotspots evolve rapidly, as shown by the totally different fine-scale recombination landscapes of humans and chimpanzees.\n",
    "Turnover might be driven by the tendency of hotspots to self-destruct through the systematic overtransmission of variants within hotspots that downregulate recombination initiation, leading to hotspot depletion and consequent selection in favor of PRDM9 variants that activate new sets of hotspots."
