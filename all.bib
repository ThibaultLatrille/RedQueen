also scaled mutation rate (or number of positions per locus)

{\`O}Inferences respecting populations, from which known samples have been drawn, cannot be expressed in terms of probability, except in the trivial case when the population is itself a sample of a super-population the speciÞcation of which is known with accuracy.{\'O} (Fisher, 1925, p.10).


Despite their growing appeal, however, there remains a troubling lack of clarity about what exactly Bayesian methods do and do not entail and about how they differ from their so-called classical counterparts. Bayesian methods are often portrayed as being based on a subjective rather than frequentist interpretation of probability, with inference being an updating of personal beliefs in light of evidence. In practice, however, most modern applications of Bayesian methods to real-world data analysis problems are characterized by pragmatism and expediency: Bayesian methods are adopted because they promise (and arguably often deliver) solutions to important or difÞcult problems. Increasingly, the subjective-Bayesian versus objective-frequentist account begins to seem like like historical baggage that has yet to be replaced by an account more in keeping with how Bayesian methods have evolved and are presently being used in psychology and other disciplines.}

annote = {- introduction assez sommaire sur la structure des genomes et leur evolution par rearrangements

cette intro manque de hauteur, en particulier, pourrait un peu mieux introduire les raisons pour lesquelles on s'interesse a l'evolution des genomes par rearrangements:
- est c utile pour reconstruire les phylogenies d'speces?
- mieux comprendre l'articulation entre fonctionnement du noyau, de la cellule (de la meiose), evenements de mutation macros (sources de rearrangements majeurs): genomique evolutive

- chapitre 1: apres introduire quelques concepts elementaires au sujet de la structure des genomes, ce chapitre pose les bases de la representation de la sucture des genomes qui sera utilisee par la suite: definition et choix des marqueurs (ici, genes codant pour prots), des evenements de rearrangement, des familles multigeniques, des vestiges de points de cassure, ds clusters de genes en tandem, et des matrices d'homologie. breve mention de bases de donnees utilisees comme point de depart (ensembl compara)

ce chapitre pose des bases essentielles pour la suite. debut du chapitre s'attarde peut etre trop sur des choses tres elementaires. pourrait commencer a I.1.7

- chapitre 2: 
segments conserves
syntenies
vestiges de clusters de genes ancestraux
definition d'un segment conserve
definition d'un bloc de syntenie
discussion sur les algos et les programmes existants, incluant phyldiag, visant a identifier les segments conserves et les blocs de syntenie
le chapitre propose enfin une evaluation de la sens/soec de phyldiag et de  adhore, sur la base de simulations

ce chapitre aurait gagn{\'e} en clarte si, apres l'introduction des definitions et la discussion de algos existants, une reprise de l'ensemble de la demarche algo de phyldiag etait proposee (avant d'enchainer sur l'analyse de sens/spec).

par ailleurs, cette analyse piurrait etre plus approfondie, plus large, plus systematique et mieux presentee

- chapitre 3: 

simuler l'evolution des genomes

introduction sur l'interet et la necessite des simulations - parallele avec abc et modalites d'aller-retour entre simulations et donnees empiriques sont insuffisamment introduits et discutes

III.2: detail de la demarche de simulation
la aussi, manque bcp de clarte sur la maniere dont les donnees empiriques sont utilisees pour calibrer/contraindre/conditionner la simu

difference conceptuelle entre
- inferer des parametres par ajustement du simulateur sur la base de stats descriptives (tel qu'effectue en fin de chapitre)
- contraindre la simulation d'emblee, sur la base d'une pre-estimation de la distribution phylogenetique des genes ancestraux, des evts geniques et du nombre de chromosomes ancestraux a partir des donnees relles (en utilisant ensembl compara)
- la demarche d'ensemble devrait etre mieux expliquee et justifiee
- plus fondamentalement, elle pose probleme



manque un chapeau general expliquant comment la methode comparative permet d'inferer
- des syntenies ancestrales (probables)
- parmi elles, des syntenies universellement conservees
- des evenements de rearrangements le long de lignees specifiques
- ces evenements definissent des points de cassure

du coup, se pise naturellement la question de la distribution des points de cassure a travers les genomes: uniforme, ou points chauds?

p 56: confusions concernant les con{\c c}epts de stats

organiser de facon logique le dialogue entre donnees empiriques et hypotheses quant aux processus macroevolutifs sous-jacents, en utilisant une methode de simulation par modeles stochastiques

or justement, beaucoup de problemes ici concernant l'articulation logique autour de cette problematique

l'expose n'est pas tres clair: tres difficile pour le lecteur de s'en sortir entre ce qui decoule des hypotheses au sujet du processus macroevolutif et et les containtes issues de donnees empiriques

le melange des genres aboutit a un resultat dans lequel on ne sais pkus trop vraiment a quel processus reel correspond ce qui est finalement produit par le simulateur

biais de selection potentiels, en particulier concenant l'ajustemeny des taux et des distributions de tailles de rearrngements ou d points de cassure: essentiellement par ce que la contrainte que les rearrangements ne soient pas muets est imposee par principe

problemes de tailles de chromosomes

suggere l'existenc d'une selection sur la taille. souleve du coup la question de comment articuler mutation et selection dans le processus de simulation

p 135: aurait ete bien de voir un graphique montrant comment l'ecart entre simu et donnees reelles varie en fonction d'un parametre cl{\'e} du modele, centr{\'e} sur la valeur de parametre pour laquell...}
